Here is a project to be carried out in pairs during a computer science course.

Our job is to code a chess game in C using the SDL library.

Here's the website to find out more about this library (which allows us to make graphics and play on them, for example): 
- https://www.libsdl.org / https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage for everything, with installation setup or link to the code of the SDL 
- the wiki_lib is very useful to be able to easily search function, things that can be done and how to implement, it's making us gain time
- --> one way to do it is by searching from the type of category of functions that act on differents parts : https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/APIByCategory
- --> the other way is by searching the name, but it requires to know well the library and what it can do : https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/CategoryAPI

We will have various tasks to complete as part of this project: 
- reproduce the game of chess and its many rules 
- create a graphical interface that is fun to play on
- code an AI to play against, with different levels
