Here is a project done in pairs we need to do during an informatic lesson

Our job is to code a chess game in C using the SDL library

Here is the website to know more about this library (that allow us to make graphics and play on them for example) : 
- https://www.libsdl.org / https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage for everything, with installation setup or link to the code of the SDL 
- the wiki_lib is very useful to be able to easily search function, things that can be done and how to implement, it's making us gain time
- --> one way to do it is by searching from the type of category of functions that act on differents parts : https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/APIByCategory
- --> the other way is by searching the name, but it requires to know well the library and what it can do : https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/CategoryAPI

We will have different tasks to do on this project : 
- replicating the chess game and its numerous rules 
- proceding to make a graphic interface where it's enjoyable to play on
- coding an AI to play against, with different levels
